# Physiological Aspects of Astrocytes in Alzheimer’s Disease  
**Final Project – BE-GY 6103: Applied Physiology for Biomedical Engineering**

## Project Overview

This project investigates the role of **astrocytes** in the development and progression of **Alzheimer’s disease (AD)**. Historically viewed as passive support cells, astrocytes are now recognized for their dynamic and dual roles in both neuroprotection and neurotoxicity.

The study combines literature analysis, biological imaging, gene expression profiling, and mathematical modeling to explore how astrocyte behavior—especially calcium dysregulation and subtype heterogeneity—contributes to AD pathology. Central to this work is the balance between **amyloid-β production and clearance**, which is modeled using a systems-level differential equation.

## Key Objectives

- Examine astrocyte subtypes (A1 neurotoxic and A2 neuroprotective) and their functional roles in AD.
- Model the impact of astrocytes on amyloid-β dynamics using a mechanistic equation.
- Analyze structural and signaling changes in astrocytes near Aβ plaques via **multiphoton microscopy**.
- Use **single-cell RNA sequencing** to classify astrocyte subpopulations and link them to disease mechanisms.

## Methods Summary

### 1. **Multiphoton Microscopy**
- Enabled high-resolution imaging of live astrocytes.
- Revealed increased calcium signaling and structural hypertrophy near Aβ plaques.
- Identified spatial correlation between plaque proximity and astrocyte reactivity.

### 2. **Single-Cell RNA Sequencing**
- Classified astrocytes into pro-inflammatory, amyloid-clearing, and metabolically dysfunctional subtypes.
- Mapped these subtypes to distinct brain regions and AD progression states.
- Identified upregulation of cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6), amyloid-clearing enzymes, and tauopathy markers.

### 3. **Mathematical Modeling**
- Developed a governing equation for **amyloid-β production and clearance**, incorporating contributions from:
  - Neurons (constitutive and death-induced Aβ production)
  - Astrocytes (APP processing)
  - Microglia and macrophages (M1/M2 phenotypes and enzymatic clearance)
- Simulated impact of parameters such as astrocyte concentration and Michaelis constant (K_Aβ).
- Demonstrated that clearance efficiency is highly sensitive to astrocyte activity and immune modulation.

## Key Findings

| Insight | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Calcium Dysregulation** | Astrocytes near plaques showed significantly higher calcium activity, indicating disrupted homeostasis. |
| **Subtype Specialization** | Pro-inflammatory astrocytes contributed to neurodegeneration; amyloid-clearing types promoted Aβ removal. |
| **Mathematical Sensitivity** | Lowering K_Aβ or increasing M2 microglial activity led to ~25–35% improved Aβ clearance. |
| **Therapeutic Implications** | Piezo1 channel, lysosomal enzymes, and immune modulators identified as potential targets for AD treatment. |

## Conclusion

This study underscores the central role of astrocytes in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Through a combination of imaging, gene expression profiling, and computational modeling, the team highlighted how astrocyte dynamics shape amyloid accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuroinflammation.

The dual roles of astrocytes—as both protectors and contributors to disease—offer a nuanced view of AD and open the door to targeted therapies that modulate astrocyte behavior. Future directions may include integrating astrocytic degradation mechanisms into computational models and testing interventions that rebalance immune and metabolic functions.
